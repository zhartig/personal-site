                    Hi, my name is Zach Hartig, and I am a Senior Software Engineer at T. Rowe Price with over 6 years
                    of experience as a full stack software engineer.
                    I have experience with a wide variety of technologies, and my main focus is on
                    designing and implementing services to run on AWS.
                    I am an expert in creating web applications using Spring
                    Boot, Express, Flask, and Angular, and I have wide experience in DevOps practices and technologies
                    like Docker, CI/CD and infrastructure as code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, I do some programming as well.  I write small scripts to automate processes that
                    I find time consuming. I also work on maintaining and enhancing my home infrastructure, which I use
                    to run these side projects.
                </p>
                <p>
